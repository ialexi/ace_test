This is a test for theming SproutCore. My work on Ace is a submodule.

So far, I have gotten progress bars to come from the theme. At the moment, they
are ugly, but hey! It uses the toolchain! Now I can work on the actual design stuff.

To generate the theme, you run (from the theme's directory):

	ruby generate_theme.rb ace.light

RMagick is required. If anyone has a library that is better/that they prefer, tell
me, as I find RMagick's install procedure on Mac to be very clunky.

Right now, the ace.light is not used, but it is still a required argument.

Where I want to go from here:

* Re-theme all of the controls.
* Rewrite sample controls app entirely
	- I will probably name it something different at first so
	  that both can be run side-by-side.
